"""Read-only guarantee: the memory-WRITE path is structurally absent.

The tool can only ever read the game's memory from another process: there is no
injector and no write primitive anywhere in the tree. These tests lock that
contract in place so a future edit can't quietly introduce a write path:

  (a) no injector module exists -- importing one fails.
  (b) core.player exposes the pure-read PlayerLocator.
  (c) model.py selects the pure-read locator.
  (d) the strong backstop: no memory-write primitive (WriteProcessMemory,
      PROCESS_VM_WRITE) appears anywhere in the farever_companion package source.
  (e) the native Rust reader (native/src) exposes no write primitive either:
      no WriteProcessMemory / VirtualAllocEx / VirtualProtectEx / PROCESS_VM_WRITE.
      The handle is opened read-only, so the shipped binary cannot write at all.

Everything here is pure source/text inspection plus a couple of guarded imports,
so it runs headless in CI with no live game, no Qt widget, and no native build.
