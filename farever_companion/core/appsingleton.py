"""GameApp-singleton anchor: scan-free, session-stable player locate.

Anchor on the GameApp singleton and pointer-chase to the local Hero, instead of
scanning the heap for ent.Hero every zone change. The anchor is cached for the
session; hero() then just re-reads a field, following character/zone changes.

The chain, validated live 2026-06-02:

    GameApp hl_type --(super, +0x18)--> App hl_type
    App hl_type_obj --(global_value, +0x38)--> &globals_data slot for $App
        *slot --> $App static object
            .inst (a GameApp)            == App.inst, the singleton
                GameApp.hero  : ent.Hero      <- the local player
                GameApp.me    : st.Player
                GameApp.layer : st.GameLayer

The only scan is finding the GameApp type once (one pass for the class name, then
a region-bounded pass for its type_obj). Offsets are re-resolved by class name so
they survive patches; resolved values are cached.
