"""Pure-read player locator (no hook, no writes).

The primary locate is the scan-free GameApp anchor in appsingleton.py. This
module keeps a heap-scan fallback for unexpected build layouts:

  1. Bootstrap the ent.Hero hl_type by class-name string (name -> type_obj ->
     hl_type). The type ptr is stable, so it's cached.
  2. Scan the rw heap for objects whose first qword is that hl_type.
  3. Prefer Hero.ownerPlayer.isMe verified by Player.hero; else the hero with the
     largest live unit list (unambiguous in solo). Calibration offsets below.
