"""Single source of truth for HashLink layout + game struct offsets.

Every offset lives here exactly once and is imported by the readers (`hl.py`,
`scene.py`, `attributes.py`, `player.py`, `appsingleton.py`) so a concept has
one name and one value. Values are validated against a specific Farever build
and resolved by class name through `hl.py` reflection where practical; the
build-validated dates stay with the readers that document each group.

Calibration-pending offsets (e.g. the per-skill level offset, the isMe path)
stay as `None`-defaulted constants in their own module, they're not shared, so
they don't belong here.
