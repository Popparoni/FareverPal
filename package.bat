REM Build the one-file exe from the committed spec (FareverPal.spec) so the
REM exact bundle contents are version controlled and can't drift between
REM machines. The spec bundles this app's own assets (always) plus optional
REM sibling game data (..\data\sheets, ..\htdocs\assets\... ) ONLY if present,
REM collects the farever_native binary, and excludes unused Qt modules. Build
REM the Rust ext first (build.bat).
